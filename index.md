## Understanding the Problem
The first step in our reaserch was understand the problem that our potential users are faced with. We tackled the problem by in turn asking ourselves three questions which to better understand the use of technology for health in our current time:

### What is a healthy lifestyle?
  We were tasked with creating an app that would encourage healthy screen habits and a healthy lifestyle. Starting off with our reasearch, we were able to break down a healthy lifestyle into the following main factors:
#### Healthy Diet and Body Weight
A healthy diet helps take in the right amount of nutrient and keep a balanced body weight. The canadian goverment does provide recommendations in the [Canadian Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/) but in brief, it includes eating a balanced amount of fruits, vegetables, proteins and grains. The guide also recommends water as a choice beverage over other alternatives. This in turn helps you maintain a balanced body weight as being undernourished or overweight can put you at risk of contracting more health complications such as obesity, heart diseases and diabetes.
#### Physical Activity
Being active is an important part of a healthy lifestyle as it helps growth in children and, similarly to a healthy diet, helps deter various chronic diseases including cancer, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
#### Mental Health
The importance of mental health is a recent concept. Mental health and physical health are actually 2 concepts that are like ying and yang: different yet ever so close and intermingled in each other. The World Health Organisation defines mental health as a "state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community". This is influenced by multiple factors other than a healthy lifestyle such as stress and/or social life. Being in a healthy mental state is also primordial to having a healthy lifestyle.
#### Good Sleep
Sleep, like nutrition, is the basis of a healthy lifestyle. It ensures your body has enough energy to work properly throughout the day. The concept of good sleep is relatively new as we discovered how better sleeping habits and sleeping posture can help us achieve a better rest and therefore, a healthier lifestyle.
#### Foreign Substances
Smoking of any sort is especially bad for lungs whether it is tobacco, weed or another substance. Alcohol on the other hand is ok in moderation but overdose can lead to a decline in mental faculties and organ failure.

### What are the impacts of technology on health?
  Aaaaaaa

## Surveys
 To further understand our users, we conducted a survey to further elicit what they need or expect from health applications. These surveys were also the basis for our user personas, based on different age groups, interests and needs from a health super app. The survey can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXmbpaGAEwBv28cvgpiyiZQf132VVsk4mRlpsMhtqeBPvRhA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

 ## User Personas
 The following user personas were derived from the results of the survey to encompass the wide range of possible users and how our application can serve their needs.
