## Understanding the Problem
The first step in our reaserch was understand the problem that our potential users are faced with. We tackled the problem by in turn asking ourselves three questions which to better understand the use of technology for health in our current time:

### What is a healthy lifestyle?
We were tasked with creating an app that would encourage healthy screen habits and a healthy lifestyle. Starting off with our reasearch, we were able to break down a healthy lifestyle into the following main factors:
#### Healthy Diet and Body Weight
A healthy diet helps take in the right amount of nutrient and keep a balanced body weight. The canadian goverment does provide recommendations in the [Canadian Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/) but in brief, it includes eating a balanced amount of fruits, vegetables, proteins and grains. The guide also recommends water as a choice beverage over other alternatives. This in turn helps you maintain a balanced body weight as being undernourished or overweight can put you at risk of contracting more health complications such as obesity, heart diseases and diabetes.
#### Physical Activity
Being active is an important part of a healthy lifestyle as it helps growth in children and, similarly to a healthy diet, helps deter various chronic diseases including cancer, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
#### Mental Health
The importance of mental health is a recent concept. Mental health and physical health are actually 2 concepts that are like ying and yang: different yet ever so close and intermingled in each other. The World Health Organisation defines mental health as a "state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community". This is influenced by multiple factors other than a healthy lifestyle such as stress and/or social life. Being in a healthy mental state is also primordial to having a healthy lifestyle.
#### Good Sleep
Sleep, like nutrition, is the basis of a healthy lifestyle. It ensures your body has enough energy to work properly throughout the day. The concept of good sleep is relatively new as we discovered how better sleeping habits and sleeping posture can help us achieve a better rest and therefore, a healthier lifestyle.
#### Foreign Substances
Smoking of any sort is especially bad for lungs whether it is tobacco, weed or another substance. Alcohol on the other hand is ok in moderation but overdose can lead to a decline in mental faculties and organ failure.

### What are the impacts of COVID-19 on health?
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on physical and mental health. Over the course of the pandemic situation, we have seen a [marked increase in technology consumption](https://www.bluefountainmedia.com/blog/impact-covid-19-future-technology) for work, but also for entertainment, especially regarding streaming content like Netflix. Technology has also become the primary means of communication with quarantining measures through applications like [Zoom which has exploded in popularity](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2020/11/20/7-ways-technology-is-helping-small-businesses-during-covid-19/) , Microsoft Teams and social media. Technology has also helped [track the spread of the COVID-19 virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html) to help keep the public safe and informed, as well as [helping hospitals manage data related to the virus](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/solutions/convergehealth-connect-for-crisis-response-health-care.html). Since people are more unable to go out, there has also been a transition of health services, [counseling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161478/), for example, that has moved online.

### What are the impacts of technology on health?
Technology has the capacity to both hinder and improve our health overall, depending on how we use it.

#### Negative Health Effects
According to [Jon Jonson in Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/negative-effects-of-technology#physical-health-effects), increased use of technology, especially social media sites can lead to increased feelings of depression, anxiety and isolation. Other physical effects include eyestrain due to long hours spent on the screen, and the brightness of these screens, as well as sleep problems caused by blue lights. Finally, perhaps the most evident negative consquence that technology has on our health is the role it plays in limiting the time we take for physical activity, which leads to a large quantity of other detrimental health effects.

#### Postive Health Effects
However, many of these effects can be mitigated with the proper techniques to make technology as beneficial for human health as possible in all regards. By using notifications, timers, and technology such as Fitbits and VR, we can bring health and activity into the realm of technology. Moreover, [A study conducted by ???](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6912378/) showed that using technology as a tool to measure health metrics like heart rate and calories lead to increased physical activity, and that the ability to link these metrics to social media to share helped to improve physical acitivity rates. Finally, technology can play an indirect impact in increasing physical activity, and thereforre health, by providing information about ways to access spaces to exercise as accessibility, safety, and aesthetics all play a role in how likely someone is to engage in physical activity. Technology also allows healthcare and health tracking to be more personalized than ever, allowing plans to be tailored to an individual, to find what is best for them. This has also lead to the rise of [health hacking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4147743/) that lets people collect and analyze their own data to take their health into their own hands.
  
## Market Research
Currently there is no app on the market that both monitors lifestyle and screen time. What most people do is that they use a collection of apps to fill all the functions they need so for example, they would use fitbit to improve their physical health in conjunction with apple fitness+ at the gym and lose it to build up healthy meals. Here follows a Venn diagram displaying what apps exist on the market and what they cover:
![Venn Diagram](assets\MarketResearch-vennDiagram.jpg)
We can see that most apps specialize with no true super app which makes it so users are forced to use multiple apps together. Also note that there is no lifestyle app that covers screen time.

## Surveys
To further understand our users, we conducted a survey to further elicit what they need or expect from health applications. These surveys were also the basis for our user personas, based on different age groups, interests and needs from a health super app. The survey can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXmbpaGAEwBv28cvgpiyiZQf132VVsk4mRlpsMhtqeBPvRhA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
 
The questions were designed to understand what our potential users found to be the most important factors for their physical and mental health and to gain an understanding of their current patterns, motivations and frustrations. Prior to answering the survey, users had to read, consent to, and sign the ethics form provided for the context of the course, to ensure that they had knowledge of why the survey was being conducted and how their data would be used. Their answers were not seen until they decided to submit them, and they also had the right not to answer any question.

The survey was split into 4 sections, listed below with their rationale.
### Age Group and Personality
The purpose of this section is to nderstand where the survey takers are located Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) spectrum, and gain insight on whether age and personality plays a factor in app usage.

There was a total of 45 respondents in these sections. Over 88% of or respondents were in the 18-25 age, 4.4% were in the 25-50 age bracket and 6.7% were in the 50 and older age bracket. These proportions were taken into account when writing the user personas,

### Healthy lifestyle
This section asked users to rank different aspects of health from depending on how cricual they perceived they were to their own personal health, and surveyed whether they   were already using fitness technology to learn more about the current market environment from our user perspective. These informations were taken into account when writing the user personnas.

From this data, we can see that when they want to have a healthier lifestyle, people would want to track/improve their diet, physical activity, sleep and mental health. We will therefore focus on these factors when designing our app in conjustion with managing screen time.

### Impacts of COVID-19
This section surveyed how COVID-19 impacted the survey taker's personal health and the degree to which they felt impacted, as well as how their perception of the pandemic impacted their technology use and activity levels.

#### Main findings

### Experience with Technology and Fitness Applications
The final section evaluated the user's experience with technology and how they interacted with social media and friends on social media. It gathered information on their motivations and frustrations with health apps, and determined whether they were more or less likely to use apps depending on certain social factors.

The final section evaluated the user's experience with technology and how they interacted with social media and friends on social media. It gathered information on their motivations and frustrations with health apps, and determined whether they were more or less likely to use apps depending on certain social factors.

As can be seen in the charts below, most of our respondents are very active on social media, as it takes up more than 2 hours of their day, making the inclusion of social media into our application an interesting path to explore, however, the results are much more mixed in terms of whether they would like to see the activity of others shared.

## User Personas and Journey Maps
### User Personas
The following user personas were derived from the results of the survey to encompass the wide range of possible users and how our application can serve their needs. We decided to make four user personas to properly distinguish between the different types of users that answered our survey, focusing on their own goals and experience with technology, as well as the motivations that would encourage them to use our application.

### Journey Maps
The following journey maps were derived from the created user personas, centered around different aspects of OmniHealth. Hashing out these journey maps for specific user personas helped focus put us in the mindset of our own clients, focaliszing on the user experience. This allowed to discern any wants or annoyances within the client, and to then make sure the application had functionalities addressed them.
