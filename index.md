## Understanding the Problem
The first step in our reaserch was understand the problem that our potential users are faced with. We tackled the problem by in turn asking ourselves three questions which to better understand the use of technology for health in our current time:

### What is a healthy lifestyle?
  We were tasked with creating an app that would encourage healthy screen habits and a healthy lifestyle. Starting off with our reasearch, we were able to break down a healthy lifestyle into the following main factors:
#### Healthy Diet and Body Weight
A healthy diet helps take in the right amount of nutrient and keep a balanced body weight. The canadian goverment does provide recommendations in the [Canadian Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/) but in brief, it includes eating a balanced amount of fruits, vegetables, proteins and grains. The guide also recommends water as a choice beverage over other alternatives. This in turn helps you maintain a balanced body weight as being undernourished or overweight can put you at risk of contracting more health complications such as obesity, heart diseases and diabetes.
#### Physical Activity
Being active is an important part of a healthy lifestyle as it helps growth in children and, similarly to a healthy diet, helps deter various chronic diseases including cancer, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
#### Mental Health
The importance of mental health is a recent concept. Mental health and physical health are actually 2 concepts that are like ying and yang: different yet ever so close and intermingled in each other. The World Health Organisation defines mental health as a "state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community". This is influenced by multiple factors other than a healthy lifestyle such as stress and/or social life. Being in a healthy mental state is also primordial to having a healthy lifestyle.
#### Good Sleep
Sleep, like nutrition, is the basis of a healthy lifestyle. It ensures your body has enough energy to work properly throughout the day. The concept of good sleep is relatively new as we discovered how better sleeping habits and sleeping posture can help us achieve a better rest and therefore, a healthier lifestyle.
#### Foreign Substances
Smoking of any sort is especially bad for lungs whether it is tobacco, weed or another substance. Alcohol on the other hand is ok in moderation but overdose can lead to a decline in mental faculties and organ failure.

### What are the impacts of COVID-19 on health?
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on physical and mental health. Over the course of the pandemic situation, we have seen a [marked increase in technology consumption](https://www.bluefountainmedia.com/blog/impact-covid-19-future-technology) for work, but also for entertainment, especially regarding streaming content like Netflix. Technology has also become the primary means of communication with quarantining measures through applications like [Zoom which has exploded in popularity](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2020/11/20/7-ways-technology-is-helping-small-businesses-during-covid-19/) , Microsoft Teams and social media. Technology has also helped [track the spread of the COVID-19 virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html) to help keep the public safe and informed, as well as [helping hospitals manage data related to the virus](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/solutions/convergehealth-connect-for-crisis-response-health-care.html). Since people are more unable to go out, there has also been a transition of health services, [counseling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161478/), for example, that has moved online.

### What are the impacts of technology on health?
Technology has the capacity to both hinder and improve our health overall, depending on how we use it.

#### Negative Health Effects
According to [Jon Jonson in Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/negative-effects-of-technology#physical-health-effects), increased use of technology, especially social media sites can lead to increased feelings of depression, anxiety and isolation. Other physical effects include eyestrain due to long hours spent on the screen, and the brightness of these screens, as well as sleep problems caused by blue lights. Finally, perhaps the most evident negative consquence that technology has on our health is the role it plays in limiting the time we take for physical activity, which leads to a large quantity of other detrimental health effects.

#### Postive Health Effects
However, many of these effects can be mitigated with the proper techniques to make technology as beneficial for human health as possible in all regards. By using notifications, timers, and technology such as Fitbits and VR, we can bring health and activity into the realm of technology. Moreover, [A study conducted by ???](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6912378/) showed that using technology as a tool to measure health metrics like heart rate and calories lead to increased physical activity, and that the ability to link these metrics to social media to share helped to improve physical acitivity rates. Finally, technology can play an indirect impact in increasing physical activity, and thereforre health, by providing information about ways to access spaces to exercise as accessibility, safety, and aesthetics all play a role in how likely someone is to engage in physical activity. Technology also allows healthcare and health tracking to be more personalized than ever, allowing plans to be tailored to an individual, to find what is best for them. This has also lead to the rise of [health hacking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4147743/) that lets people collect and analyze their own data to take their health into their own hands.
  
## Market Research

## Surveys
 To further understand our users, we conducted a survey to further elicit what they need or expect from health applications. These surveys were also the basis for our user personas, based on different age groups, interests and needs from a health super app. The survey can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXmbpaGAEwBv28cvgpiyiZQf132VVsk4mRlpsMhtqeBPvRhA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

 ## User Personas
 The following user personas were derived from the results of the survey to encompass the wide range of possible users and how our application can serve their needs. We decided to make four user personas to properly distinguish between the different types of users that answered our survey, focusing on their own goals and experience with technology, as well as the motivations that would encourage them to use our application.
