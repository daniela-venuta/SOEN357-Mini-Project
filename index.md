## Understanding the Problem
The first step in our reaserch was understand the problem that our potential users are faced with. We tackled the problem by in turn asking ourselves three questions which to better understand the use of technology for health in our current time:

### What is a healthy lifestyle?
We were tasked with creating an app that would encourage healthy screen habits and a healthy lifestyle. Starting off with our reasearch, we were able to break down a healthy lifestyle into the following main factors:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Healthy Diet and Body Weight</strong></summary>
  
<p>A healthy diet helps take in the right amount of nutrient and keep a balanced body weight. The canadian goverment does provide recommendations in the [Canadian Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/). Being undernourished or overweight can put you at risk of contracting more health complications such as obesity, heart diseases and diabetes.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Physical Activity</strong></summary>

<p>Being active is an important part of a healthy lifestyle as it helps growth in children and, similarly to a healthy diet, helps deter various chronic diseases including cancer, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Mental Health</strong></summary>
    
<p>The World Health Organisation defines mental health as a "state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community". Mental Health and Physical health are closely related and being in a healthy mental state contributes to being healthy physically.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Good Sleep</strong></summary>
    
<p>Sleep, like nutrition, is the basis of a healthy lifestyle. It ensures your body has enough energy to work properly throughout the day. The concept of good sleep is relatively new as we discovered how better sleeping habits and sleeping posture can help us achieve a better rest and therefore, a healthier lifestyle.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Foreign Substances consumption</strong></summary>
    
<p>Smoking of any sort is especially bad for lungs whether it is tobacco, weed or another substance. Alcohol on the other hand is ok in moderation but overdose can lead to a decline in mental faculties and organ failure.</p>
</details>

### What are the impacts of COVID-19 on health?
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on physical and mental health. Over the course of the pandemic situation, we have seen a [marked increase in technology consumption](https://www.bluefountainmedia.com/blog/impact-covid-19-future-technology) for work, but also for entertainment, especially regarding streaming content like Netflix. Technology has also become the primary means of communication with quarantining measures through applications like [Zoom which has exploded in popularity](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2020/11/20/7-ways-technology-is-helping-small-businesses-during-covid-19/) , Microsoft Teams and social media. Technology has also helped [track the spread of the COVID-19 virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html) to help keep the public safe and informed, as well as [helping hospitals manage data related to the virus](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/solutions/convergehealth-connect-for-crisis-response-health-care.html). Since people are more unable to go out, there has also been a transition of health services, [counseling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161478/), for example, that has moved online.

### What are the impacts of technology on health?
Technology has the capacity to both hinder and improve our health overall, depending on how we use it. According to [Jon Jonson in Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/negative-effects-of-technology#physical-health-effects), increased use of technology, especially social media sites can lead to increased feelings of depression, anxiety and isolation. Other physical effects include eyestrain due to long hours spent on the screen, and the brightness of these screens, as well as sleep problems caused by blue lights. Finally, perhaps the most evident negative consquence that technology has on our health is the role it plays in limiting the time we take for physical activity, which leads to a large quantity of other detrimental health effects.

However, technology can also be used to benefit human health. [A study published in the journal of clinical medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6912378/) showed that using technology as a tool to measure health metrics like heart rate and calories lead to increased physical activity, and that the ability to link these metrics to social media to share helped to improve physical acitivity rates. Using VR and gamification of physical activities also helps reach populations who would otherwise not be interested in fitness. Technology also allows healthcare and health tracking to be more personalized than ever, leading to the rise of [health hacking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4147743/) which lets people collect and analyze their own data to take their health into their own hands.
  
## Market Research
Currently there is no app on the market that both monitors lifestyle and screen time. What most people do is that they use a collection of apps to fill all the functions they need so for example, they would use fitbit to improve their physical health in conjunction with apple fitness+ at the gym and lose it to build up healthy meals. Here follows a Venn diagram displaying what apps exist on the market and what they cover:
![Venn Diagram](assets\MarketResearch-vennDiagram.jpg)
We can see that most apps specialize with no true super app which makes it so users are forced to use multiple apps together. Also note that there is no lifestyle app that covers screen time. Daylio is a diary kind of app which allows it to fill many functions but it was primarily designed around feelings so it is in essence a mental support app.

## Surveys
To further understand our users, we conducted a survey to further elicit what they need or expect from health applications. These surveys were also the basis for our user personas, based on different age groups, interests and needs from a health super app. The survey can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXmbpaGAEwBv28cvgpiyiZQf132VVsk4mRlpsMhtqeBPvRhA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

The questions were designed to understand what our potential users found to be the most important factors for their physical and mental health and to gain an understanding of their current patterns, motivations and frustrations. Prior to answering the survey, users had to read, consent to, and sign the ethics form provided for the context of the course, to ensure that they had knowledge of why the survey was being conducted and how their data would be used. Their answers were not seen until they decided to submit them, and they also had the right not to answer any question.

<details>
  <summary><strong style="font-size:1.17em">Age Group and Personality</strong></summary>

<hr><p>The purpose of this section is to understand where the survey takers are located Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) spectrum, and gain insight on whether age and personality plays a factor in app usage.</p>
<p>There was a total of 45 respondents in these sections. Over 88% of or respondents were in the 18-25 age, 4.4% were in the 25-50 age bracket and 6.7% were in the 50 and older age bracket. These proportions were taken into account when writing the user personas.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong style="font-size:1.17em">Healthy Lifestyle</strong></summary>

<hr><p>This section asked users to rank different aspects of health from depending on how cricual they perceived they were to their own personal health, and surveyed whether they   were already using fitness technology to learn more about the current market environment from our user perspective. These informations were taken into account when writing the user personnas.</p>
<img src="assets\Survey-healthyLifestyleFactors.png" alt="LifestyleFactors">
<p>From this data, we can see that when they want to have a healthier lifestyle, people would want to track/improve their diet, physical activity, sleep and mental health. We will therefore focus on these factors when designing our app in conjustion with managing screen time.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong style="font-size:1.17em">Impacts of COVID-19</strong></summary>

<hr><p>This section surveyed how COVID-19 impacted the survey taker's personal health and the degree to which they felt impacted, as well as how their perception of the pandemic impacted their technology use and activity levels.</p>

<img src="assets\Survey-covidAndOutdoors.png" alt="COVID and outdoors">
<img src="assets\Survey-covidAndTech.png" alt="COVID and tech">
<img src="assets\Survey-covidImpactOnHealth.png" alt="COVID and health">

<p>This section of the survey highlight several important feelings that a majority of the respondents felt accross all age groups. Overall, the pandmic had a significant impact on how they perceived their overall health. Most participants noticed an increase in their technology use, and felt that the pandemic was hindering their ability to go outside to get physical activity/ They also felt that their ability to socialize, exciize and maintain their social needs were mostly impacted by the pandemic. The graph below show the findings across all age groups.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong style="font-size:1.17em">Experience with Technology and Fitness Apps</strong></summary>

<hr><p>The final section evaluated the user's experience with technology and how they interacted with social media and friends on social media. It gathered information on their motivations and frustrations with health apps, and determined whether they were more or less likely to use apps depending on certain social factors.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the charts below, most of our respondents are very active on social media, as it takes up more than 2 hours of their day, making the inclusion of social media into our application an interesting path to explore, however, the results are much more mixed in terms of whether they would like to see the activity of others shared.</p>

## User Personas and Journey Maps
### User Personas
The following user personas were derived from the results of the survey to encompass the wide range of possible users and how our application can serve their needs. We decided to make four user personas to properly distinguish between the different types of users that answered our survey, focusing on their own goals and experience with technology, as well as the motivations that would encourage them to use our application.

### Journey Maps
The following journey maps were derived from the created user personas, centered around different aspects of OmniHealth. Hashing out these journey maps for specific user personas helped focus put us in the mindset of our own clients, focaliszing on the user experience. This allowed to discern any wants or annoyances within the client, and to then make sure the application had functionalities addressed them.
 
### The "Fit Dad"
 ![NicolasGace-Persona](assets\NicolasGace-persona.jpg)
 ![NicolasGace-JourneyMap](assets\NicolasGace-JourneyMap.jpg)
 This user persona is derived from older age groups in our surveys, that are incredibly active and are focused on hacking their health data to improve their athletic performance and overall health. Getting analytics back is very important to them, and want to be able to access this information easily to put it to good use. They also want to challenge each other, which is why social features are important to them.
 
### The "Fitness Enthousiast"
 ![MarcusDantin-Persona](assets\MarcusDantin-persona.jpg)
 ![MarcusDantin-JourneyMap](assets\MarcusDantin-JourneyMap.jpg)
 This persona is formed from a tech savvy younger age group who works out frequently and is quite familiar with technology. They want applications to be customizable to their needs to keep their health schedule on track, and are motivated by seeing history and improvement in terms of their overall fitness. They are extroverted but still concerned about privacy, so their data is important to them, but they are less likely to share it on social apps.
 
### The "Working Mom"
 ![SylviaSmith-Persona](assets\SylviaSmith-persona.jpg)
 ![SylviaSmith-JourneyMap](assets\SylviaSmith-JourneyMap.jpg)
This persona is a that wants to keep track of specific health habits for themselves, and take that information with them to medical appointments, they are more focused on certain features like screen time, and food and sleep tracking, and are less familiar with the concept of a super app. They want to see results from their tracking, but are not on a specific plan or schedule.

### The "Casual User"
 ![KatelynRoss-Persona](assets\KatelynRoss-persona.jpg)
 ![KatelynRoss-JourneyMap](assets\KatelynRoss-JourneyMap.jpg)
This user is familiar with technology and uses many apps to explore how they can benefit their health but can benefit from having them all under one umbrella. They are introverted, and conscious of themselves, and want an easy way to keep track of all the apps they use.
# Sketches

# Colour Palette
![Colour Palette](assets\colour%20palette.png)

The main colours for our applications are all purple hues. These colours were chosen for their wide appeal, and because purple is both [calming, and energetic](https://www.bourncreative.com/meaning-of-the-color-purple/#:~:text=Purple%20combines%20the%20calm%20stability,mystery%2C%20independence%2C%20and%20magic) as it has hues of both blue and red. Users will be spending a lot of time on the application so it was important to select colours that would not cause eye strain due to their brightness. It goes well with both the calmer uses such as sleep tracking and screen time tracking, but also provides the energy needed to track workouts and fitness.

# Mockup
The mockup is a collection of 15 screens that are combined to create our super app. Our application qualifies as a super app because it encompasses a wide variety of services that are easily accessible through the app's main page. These are shown as in-house developped features but can also be included as as 3rd party software if desired. The reason they were illustrated as in-house technology is because the team felt that we could provide more tailored services to our users based on their personas to offer the best fit for them. It combines many different functions based on the different aspects of health that our surveys showed were important to our users. Below is the list of important features and services that the super app offers,

<details>
  <summary><strong>Login Page and Account Creation</strong></summary>
  <p>The login page is design to be simple and hassle free, it allows users to save and keep track of their personal info in a secure manner, as privacy was a main concern for many users.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Home Navigation Screen</strong></summary>
  <p>This screen is the portal to all the services that are provided by the super app. From here, we can access the main services: Screen Tracking, Food Tracking, Exercise Tracking, Friends and Messaging, Sleep Tracking, and Account Customization.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Screentime Tracking</strong></summary>
  <p>This service is split up into many different screens. The first page that a user lands on provides an overview of how many hours they have spent on each of their apps over the course of the week. They can click on this overview to get a more detailed breakdown of hours per day in a graph and compare it to the goal they have set for themselves. From here, they can also choose to create work modes to block applications, depending on what they want to focus on. This allows users to focus on their work, themselves, their exercise, or whatever else they may be doing by disabling apps that might be distracting at that time.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise Tracking</strong></summary>
  <p>The exercise tracking screen is a simple interface that provides a step counter but goes further into pages for finding locations, or tracking cardio or strength exercises. They can also get map data from their location to learn about how crowded certain exercise spots are and determine what measures to take to protect themselves from COVID-19 and assess risk. This service was provided because of the high number of people in the survey that reported that anxiety over COVID-19 has prevented them from seeking outdoor physical activity. The detailed logging in the exercise subscreens allow fitness enthusiasts to keep track of their past workouts and record important metrics.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Sleep Tracking</strong></summary>
  <p>This service allows users to rank their quality of sleep and number of hours slept. It's calendar view allows easy long term tracking and shows how your habits have influenced your sleep over long periods of time.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Food Tracking</strong></summary>
  <p>This service provides basic calorie counting, and meal tracking and can communicate with the internet to help find foods and their nutritional content to log.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Friends and Messaging</strong></summary>
  <p>These feature was designed to incorporate social aspects into our application and it was incredibly important to many people who responded in the survey noted how important social features are, and social interaction is an important component of health. It also allows sharing your activity to your in-app friends to keep the spirit of competition alive for those who think this is important like those who fit the "Fit Dad" archetype.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Account Settings and Linking</strong></summary>
  <p>This screen allows you to customize any settings to your will, and turn off any social features if you want your data to remain private. It also allows you to connect different to different social apps like Facebook, Instagram, Google and Twitter to share your progress and acheivements. It is also through here that users can generate personalized reports based off of the metrics that have been recorded in the application.</p>

# Prototype

Below is the prototype of the application, it is not meant to be a fully functional prototype, but rather a concept meant to provide insight on the flow of the app, and navigation between the pages, as well as a more robust experience on what the application would appear like on the mobile device. The prototype has several functioning buttons to navigate between pages and is scrollable.

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FLXF5BgSzYSb7XUnbkNRak5%2FMockup%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A1869%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen></iframe>

# Closing Remarks

The development of these user interface and user experience prototypes allowed us to consider a wide variety of users and their needs. It was important for our application to provide a wide variety of services that can be useful both for hardcore health and fitness enthusiasts as well as more casual users and provide the ability to customize the app to their prefered experience. For this reason, all basic services can be accessed easily through the main hub, but those who want more are free to explore different pages that can provide them with more tailored services. It also gives users flexibility in their privacy and to share only what they want to with the world. OmniHealth is an application that improves the overall health and wellbeing of its users by letting them be more conscious of their screentime, and by gathering under one app all the main factors of health: physical, mental, and social.
