# Introducing OmniHealth
Apps are being constantly introduced to the market, be it social media, games, or health trackers. With so many viable options regarding fitness apps, one may come to find it tedious and space consuming to own multiple apps. Acting as a standalone hub, OmniHealth takes care of that by combining the functionality of multiple trackers (screen time, exercise, sleep, and calorie intake). 

## Understanding the Problem
The first step in our reaserch was to understand the problem our targeted users we facing. We tackled the problem by in turn asking ourselves three questions to better understand the use of technology for health in our current time:

### What is a healthy lifestyle?
Wanting to create an app that would encourage healthy screen habits and a healthy lifestyle, we started off our reasearch by breaking down what a healthy lifestyle consisted of. We found our answer in the following factors:

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Healthy Diet and Body Weight</b>
  </summary>
    <br/>
  <p>
    Following a healthy diet allows your body to intake the right amount of nutrient while keeping a balanced body weight. The canadian goverment provides recommendations in the <a href="https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/">Canadian Food Guide</a> regarding the quantity of each food group to consume. Being undernourished or overweight can put you at risk of contracting more health complications, such as obesity, heart diseases and diabetes.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Physical Activity</b>
  </summary>
    <br/>
  <p>
    Being active is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, as it helps growth in children and, similarly to a healthy diet, helps deter various chronic diseases including cancer, type 2 diabetes and hypertension, among others. Keeping active is necessary for the body, as it helps keep our systems in check by reinforcing bones and muscles. Working out is not only beneficial physically, but also mentally.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Mental Health</b>
  </summary>
    <br/>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5526-2">World Health Organisation</a> defines mental health as a "state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community". Mental health and physical health are closely related and being in a healthy mental state contributes to being healthy physically.
      <br/>
    As stated by <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/press_releases/obesity_exercise_and_effects#:~:text=Like%20most%20mind%2Dbody%20interactions,the%20psychological%20benefits%20of%20exercise.">Harvard</a>, declining physical health may lead to declining mental health. Body images can affect one's perception of themselves and can consequently affect their self-esteeem. It was also proven by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm">CDC</a> that physical activity is said to help cognition in children aged 6-13, reduce mental strain such as anxiety and depression, as well as help improve sleeping quality. 
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Good Sleep</b>
  </summary>
    <br/>
  <p>
    Sleep, like nutrition, is the basis of a healthy lifestyle. It ensures your body has enough energy to work properly throughout the day. Though the benefits of good sleep have been discovered relatively recently, it has already been proven that sleeping well and enough helps reduce the risk of diabetes, heart diseases and cognitive decline. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/in-search-of-sleep">Harvard</a> also startes that the state of deep sleep is an essential step in cleaning and repairing the body. It was also said that sleeping postures can affect your health and, as such, we can conlude that better rest contributes to living a healthier lifestyle.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Consumption of Foreign Substances</b>
  </summary>
    <br/>
  <p>
    Smoking any substance is especially bad for lungs whether it is tobacco, weed or another substance. Not only does it cause heart diseases, diabetes and lung cancer, but the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/health_effects/index.htm#:~:text=Smoking%20causes%20cancer%2C%20heart%20disease,immune%20system%2C%20including%20rheumatoid%20arthritis.">CDC</a> says it also negatively impacts the immune system and the respiratory system.
      <br/>
    Alcohol on the other hand is acceptable if consumed in moderation. However an abusive frequency or ingested quantity can lead to a decline in mental faculties and organ failure, as stated by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm">CDC</a>.
  </p>
</details>

<br/>

### What are the impacts of COVID-19 on health?
The COVID-19 pandemic has globally had a huge impact on physical and mental health. Over the course of the pandemic situation, we have seen a [marked increase in technology consumption](https://www.bluefountainmedia.com/blog/impact-covid-19-future-technology) not only for work, but also for entertainment, especially regarding streaming content like Netflix and Disney+. Technology has also become the primary means of communication with quarantining measures through applications like [Zoom, which has exploded in popularity](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2020/11/20/7-ways-technology-is-helping-small-businesses-during-covid-19/), Microsoft Teams and social media. Technology has also helped [track the spread of the COVID-19 virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html) to help keep the public safe and informed, as well as [helping hospitals manage data related to the virus](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/solutions/convergehealth-connect-for-crisis-response-health-care.html). Since people are more restricted in the location and frequency of their outings, there has also been a transition of health services, [counseling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161478/), for example, to online platforms.

### What are the impacts of technology on health?
Technology has the capacity to both hinder and improve our health overall, depending on how we use it. According to [Jon Jonson in Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/negative-effects-of-technology#physical-health-effects), increased use of technology, especially social media sites can lead to increased feelings of depression, anxiety and isolation. Other physical effects include eyestrain due to long hours spent on the screen, and the brightness of these screens, as well as sleep problems caused by blue lights. Finally, perhaps the most evident negative consquence that technology has on our health is the role it plays in limiting the time we take for physical activity, which leads to a large quantity of other detrimental health effects, as previously mentioned.
  <br/>
However, technology can also be used to benefit human health. [A study published in the journal of clinical medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6912378/) showed that using technology as a tool to measure health metrics like heart rate and calories lead to increased physical activity, and that the ability to link these metrics to social media to share your progress with others helped to improve physical acitivity rates. Using VR and gamification of physical activities also helps reach populations who would otherwise not be interested in fitness. Technology also allows healthcare and health tracking to be more personalized than ever, leading to the rise of [health hacking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4147743/), which lets people collect and analyze their own data to take their health matters into their own hands.
  
## Market Research
Currently there are no apps on the market that monitor both lifestyle and screen time the way OmniHealth would offer to. What most people do is use a collection of apps to fill in all the functions they need. For example, they would use <i>Fitbit</i> to improve their physical health in conjunction with <i>Apple Fitness+</i> at the gym and <i>Lose It!</i> to build up healthy meals. The following Venn diagram displays what apps exist on the market and what disciplines they cover:
![Venn Diagram](assets\MarketResearch-vennDiagram.jpg)
  <br/>
We can observe that most apps specialize in their own discpline, with no true app that englobes all categories.The lack of such a super app forces users to download and use multiple apps. We can also notice there is no true leader in the lifestyle division that manages screen time. Though <i>Daylio</i> is a diary type of app, which allows it to fill many functionalities, it was primarily designed around feelings, which makes its essence more of a mental support app.

## Surveys
To further understand our users, we conducted a survey to further elicit what they need or expect from health applications. The answers to this survey were also the basis for our user personas, based on different age groups, interests, and expected needs for the creation of a health super app. The survey can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXmbpaGAEwBv28cvgpiyiZQf132VVsk4mRlpsMhtqeBPvRhA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

The questions were designed to understand what our potential users found to be the most important factors for their physical and mental health and to gain an understanding of their current patterns, motivations and frustrations. Prior to answering the survey, users had to read, consent to, and sign the ethics form provided for the context of the course, to ensure that they had knowledge of why the survey was being conducted and how their data would be used. Their answers were not seen until they decided to submit them, and they also had the right to forgo the survey entirely and not answer any questions.

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Age Group and Personality</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    The purpose of this section is to understand where the survey takers are located on an overly simplified Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) spectrum, and gain insight on whether age and personality plays a factor in app usage.
  <br/>
    There was a total of 45 respondents in these sections. Over 88% of or respondents were in the 18-25 age, 4.4% were in the 25-50 age bracket and 6.7% were in the 50 and older age bracket. These proportions were taken into account when writing the user personas.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Healthy Lifestyle</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    This section asked users to rank different aspects of health depending on how crucial they perceived they were to their own personal health. This section also surveyed whether they were already using fitness technology, which would in turn allow us to learn more about the current market environment from our users' perspective. This information was taken into account when writing the user personnas.
  </p>
  <img src="assets\Survey-healthyLifestyleFactors.png" alt="LifestyleFactors">
  <p>
    From the above data, we can see that when users want to have a healthier lifestyle, they tend to track/improve their diet, physical activity, sleep and mental health. We will therefore focus on these factors when designing our app in conjunction with managing screen time.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Impacts of COVID-19</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    This section surveyed how COVID-19 impacted the survey taker's personal health and the degree to which they felt impacted, as well as how their perception of the pandemic impacted their technology use and activity levels. The graphs below show the findings across all age groups.
  </p>

  <img src="assets\Survey-covidAndOutdoors.png" alt="COVID and outdoors">
  <img src="assets\Survey-covidAndTech.png" alt="COVID and tech">
  <img src="assets\Survey-covidImpactOnHealth.png" alt="COVID and health">

  <p>
    This section of the survey highlighted several important feelings that a majority of the respondents felt accross all age groups. Overall, the pandmic had a significant impact on how they perceived their overall health. Most participants noticed an increase in their technology use, and felt that the pandemic was hindering their ability to go outside to partake in physical activities. They also felt that their ability to socialize, exercise and maintain their social needs were mostly impacted by the pandemic.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Experience with Technology and Fitness Apps</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    The final section evaluated the user's experience with technology and how they interacted with social media and friends on social media. It gathered information on their motivations and frustrations with health apps, and determined whether they were more or less likely to use apps depending on certain social factors.
      <br/>
    As can be seen in the charts below, most of our respondents are very active on social media, as they replied they spend more than 2 hours of their day interacting with social media. This makes the inclusion of social media into our application an interesting path to explore. However, the answers were much less unilateral when it came to whether they wanted to share their own progress to others and see other people's progress and usage of the app.

## User Personas and Journey Maps
### User Personas
The following user personas were derived from the results of the survey to encompass the wide range of possible users and how our application can serve their needs. We decided to make four user personas to properly distinguish between the different types of users that answered our survey, focusing on their own goals and experience with technology, as well as the motivations that would encourage them to use our application.

### Journey Maps
The following journey maps were derived from the created user personas, centered around different aspects of OmniHealth. Hashing out these journey maps for specific user personas helped focus put us in the mindset of our own clients, focaliszing on the user experience. This allowed to discern any wants or annoyances within the client, and to then make sure the application had functionalities addressing them.
 
### The "Fit Dad"
 ![NicolasGace-Persona](assets\NicolasGace-persona.jpg)
 ![NicolasGace-JourneyMap](assets\NicolasGace-JourneyMap.jpg)
  <br/>
 This user persona is derived from the older age groups in our surveys that are incredibly active and are focused on hacking their health data to improve their athletic performance and overall health. Getting analytics is very important to them, and they want to be able to access this information easily to put it to good use. They also want to challenge each other, which is why the implementation of social features are important to them.
 
### The "Fitness Enthousiast"
 ![MarcusDantin-Persona](assets\MarcusDantin-persona.jpg)
 ![MarcusDantin-JourneyMap](assets\MarcusDantin-JourneyMap.jpg)
  <br/>
 This persona is based off a tech savvy younger age group who works out frequently and is quite familiar with technology. They want applications to be customizable to their needs to keep their health schedule on track, and are motivated by seeing history and improvement in terms of their overall fitness. They are extroverted but still concerned about privacy, so their data is important to them, but they are less likely to share it on social media apps.
 
### The "Working Mom"
 ![SylviaSmith-Persona](assets\SylviaSmith-persona.jpg)
 ![SylviaSmith-JourneyMap](assets\SylviaSmith-JourneyMap.jpg)
  <br/>
This persona is one that wants to keep track of specific health habits for themselves, and take that information with them to medical appointments. They are more focused on specific features like screen time, food and sleep tracking, and are less familiar with the concept of a super app. They want to see results from their tracking, but are not dead set on having a specific plan or schedule.

### The "Casual User"
 ![KatelynRoss-Persona](assets\KatelynRoss-persona.jpg)
 ![KatelynRoss-JourneyMap](assets\KatelynRoss-JourneyMap.jpg)
  <br/>
This user is familiar with technology and uses many apps to explore how they can benefit their health. Though this user is used to technology, it can benefit from having an umbrella-app that would encompass all other apps. They are introverted, and conscious of themselves, and want an easy way to keep track of all the apps they use.

# Sketches
The following was our initial sketch of the app, after having received all survey responses.
  <br/>
<img src="assets\design%20sketch.jpg" height=450px>

# Colour Palette
![Colour Palette](assets\colour%20palette.png)

The main colours for our applications are all purple hues. These colours were chosen for their wide appeal, and because purple is both [calming, and energetic](https://www.bourncreative.com/meaning-of-the-color-purple/#:~:text=Purple%20combines%20the%20calm%20stability,mystery%2C%20independence%2C%20and%20magic), as it is a mix of both blue and red hues. Users will be spending a lot of time on the application, so it was important to select colours that would not be straining to the eye due to their brightness. It goes well with both the calmer uses such as sleep tracking and screen time tracking, but also provides the energy needed to track workouts and fitness.

# Mockup
The mockup is a collection of 15 screens that are combined to create our super app. Our application qualifies as a super app because it encompasses a wide variety of services that are easily accessible through the app's main page. These are shown as in-house developped features but can also be included as as 3rd party software if desired. The reason they were illustrated as in-house technology is because the team felt that we could provide more tailored services to our users based on their personas to offer the best fit for them. It combines many different functions based on the different aspects of health that our surveys showed were important to our users.
  <br/>
Below is the list of important features and services that the super app offers,

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Login Page and Account Creation</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    The login page is design to be simple and hassle free, it allows users to save and keep track of their personal info in a secure manner, as privacy was a main concern for many users.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Home Navigation Screen</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    This screen is the portal to all the services that are provided by the super app. From here, we can access the main services: Screen Tracking, Food Tracking, Exercise Tracking, Friends and Messaging, Sleep Tracking, and Account Customization.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Screentime Tracking</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    This service is split up into many different screens. The first page that a user lands on provides an overview of how many hours a user has spent on each of their apps over the course of the week. They can click on this overview to get a more detailed breakdown of hours per day in a graph and compare it to the goal they have set for themselves. From here, they can also choose to create work modes to block applications, depending on what they want to focus on. This allows users to focus on their work, themselves, their exercise, or whatever else they may be doing by disabling apps that might be distracting at that time.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Exercise Tracking</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    The exercise tracking screen is a simple interface that provides a step counter but goes further into pages for finding locations, or tracking cardio and strength exercises. Users can also get map data from their location to learn about how crowded certain exercise spots are and determine what measures to take to protect themselves from COVID-19 and assess risk. This service was provided because of the high number of people in the survey that reported that anxiety over COVID-19 has prevented them from seeking outdoor physical activity. The detailed logging in the exercise subscreens allow fitness enthusiasts to keep track of their past workouts and record important metrics.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Sleep Tracking</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    This service allows users to rank their quality of sleep and number of hours slept. Its calendar view allows easy long term tracking and shows how user habits have influenced their sleep over long periods of time.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Food Tracking</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    This service provides basic calorie counting, and meal tracking. It can also communicate with the internet to help find foods and their nutritional values to log.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Friends and Messaging</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    This screen was designed to incorporate social aspects into our application, as it was incredibly important to many people who had taken our survey. They had noted how important social features are, and social interaction is an important component of health, both mental and physical. This screen also allows users to share their activity with their in-app friends to keep the spirit of competition alive. This caters to people with a competitive spirit, like those who fit the "Fit Dad" archetype.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Account Settings and Linking</b>
  </summary>
    <br>
  <p>
    This screen allows users to customize their settings at will, and to turn off any social features, should they want their data to remain private. This screen also allows users to connect different to different social apps like Facebook, Instagram, Google and Twitter to share their progress and achievements with their friends. It is also through here that users can generate personalized reports based off of the metrics that have been recorded in the application.
  </p>
</details>
<br>

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="700" height="300" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FLXF5BgSzYSb7XUnbkNRak5%2FMockup%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

# Prototype

Below is the prototype of the application. It is not meant to be a fully functional prototype, but rather a concept meant to provide insight on the flow of the app, and navigation between the pages, as well as a more robust experience on what the application would appear like on the mobile device. The prototype has several functioning buttons to navigate between pages and is also scrollable.

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="700" height="300" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FLXF5BgSzYSb7XUnbkNRak5%2FMockup%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A1869%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen></iframe>

# Closing Remarks

The development of these user interface and user experience prototypes allowed us to consider a wide variety of users and their needs. It was important for our application to provide a wide variety of services that can be useful both for hardcore health and fitness enthusiasts as well as more casual users and provide the ability to customize the app to their prefered experience. For this reason, all basic services can be accessed easily through the main hub, but users looking for a more extensive experience are free to explore different pages that can provide them with more tailored services. It also gives users flexibility in their privacy and to share only what they want to with the world. OmniHealth is an application that improves the overall health and wellbeing of its users by letting them be more conscious of their screentime, and by gathering under one app all the main factors of health: physical, mental, and social.
